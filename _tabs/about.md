Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm a passionate data scientist with a diverse background in Economics and a keen interest in exploring the world of Machine Learning and with Machine Learning. Throughout my career, I have delved into various ML pet projects, experimenting with cutting-edge algorithms and techniques. This platform serves as a hub for sharing my experiences, insights, and lessons learned along the way. 

Aside from the technical realm, I also enjoy delving into topics outside of the tech sphere that captivate me. With proficiency in English, Russian, solid grasp of Japanese, Chinese, and a growing knowledge of French and Dutch, I embrace the multicultural aspect of my life and look forward to incorporating my  experiences into my writings. Join me on this exciting journey as we dive into the realm of ML, data science, and beyond.
